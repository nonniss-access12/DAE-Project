            <h4>Type of Business / Planning</h4>
            <p>The type of business I am planning on doing is a costume and prop shop. I am focusing on selling high-quality costumes and firearms for the Carnaval de Huejotzingo. These include Zacapoaxtlas, Indios, Zapadores, Zuavos, and Turks, each with their own unique pieces. For example, the costumes will come in full suits with their respective pieces (hats, jackets, pants, etc.). Additionally, I plan to sell high quality hand-carved muskets and gun powder to customers.</p>

            <h4> One of a Kind / Unique</h4>
            <p>My business is unique for multiple reasons. Firstly, it will sell high-quality costumes and accessories specific to the Carnaval de Huejotzingo, which are in high demand. Secondly, the costumes and accessories are expensive and not widely available, making my business one of the few places people can find them. Thirdly, by selling hand-carved muskets and gunpowder, my business will cater to customers who need them for the carnaval reenactment, further expanding my target market. Most importantly, I am selling costumes that truly reflect the traditional and authentic style of the Carnaval, setting my business apart from other costume providers.</p>
