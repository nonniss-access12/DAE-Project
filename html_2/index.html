    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <img src="costume.jpg" alt="Colorful costumes" width="300">
    <p><em>¡Viva México!</em> The Carnival of Huejotzingo is the only carnival of its kind and one of the most important in Mexico. It is noted for its unique traditions which center on the municipality's history as well as the use of tons of gunpowder used in hand-carved muskets in mock battles and other events. The carnival involves more than 12,000 residents in costume, most of which are dressed in outfits related to elements of the armies that fought in the Battle of Puebla.</p>

    <h3>TYPE OF BUSINESS / PLANNING</h3>
    <img src="Carnaval-de-Huejotzingo.jpg" alt="Business planning photo" width="300">
    <p>The type of business I am planning on doing is a costume and prop shop. I am focusing on selling high-quality costumes and firearms for the Carnaval de Huejotzingo. These include Zacapoaxtlas, Indios, Zapadores, Zuavos, and Turks, each with their own unique pieces. For example, the costumes will come in full suits with their respective pieces (hats, jackets, pants, etc.).</p>

    <h3>SUCCESS / GROWTH POTENTIAL</h3>
    <img src="musket.jpg" alt="Customer interest" width="300">
    <p>My business is promised to be successful. Its potential to be a success is because it will cater to a demand for high-quality, traditional costumes and accessories for the Carnaval de Huejotzingo, which is popular in Mexico and certain parts of the U.S. These items are known to be costly, so providing them at a lower or comparable price can attract customers. Given the significance of the Carnival, there can be a large customer base, and the business can continue to grow as more people become aware of its offerings.</p>

    <h3>ONE OF A KIND / UNIQUE</h3>
    <img src="munecos-carnavaleros-en-huejotzingo-melanie.jpg" alt="Unique pieces" width="300">
    <p>My business is unique for multiple reasons. Firstly, it will sell high-quality costumes and accessories specific to the Carnaval de Huejotzingo, which are in high demand. Secondly, the costumes and accessories are expensive and not widely available, making my business one of the few places people can find them. Thirdly, by selling hand-carved muskets and gunpowder, my business will cater to customers who need them for the carnival reenactment, further expanding my target market.</p>
